<p>The Turkish city of Gaziantep hosted the Osama Jumaa Festival in August 2017, to remember and pay respect to late photojournalist Osama Jumaa, one year after his tragic death, as well as to celebrate his work, which Osama had always accomplished with great integrity, courage, and professionalism

The festival included photo-exhibitions by IMAGESLIVE photojournalists, about the Arab Spring uprisings and the conflicts which followed some of the Arab Spring revolutions in some Arab countries. The festival also featured the screening of film documentaries related to the Arab Spring and the conflicts ensuing the uprisings. Teaching workshops were also held in journalism, photojournalism, and documentary filmmaking for university students. The event also hosted traditional and folkloric singing and performances. Journalists, photographers, film makers, intellectuals, artists, politicians, distinguished figures from the civil society, attended the event, in addition to university students and the general public.

The city of Gaziantep, located in southern Turkey and close to the Turkish-Syrian border, wasn’t a casual choice but rather a deliberate one based on the fact that Osama had spent substantial periods in Gaziantep and had received most of his training in journalism, photography, and filming in the Turkish town. It was during Osama’s last return to Aleppo from Gaziantep, that he lost his life as he was filming an intense bombardment in Aleppo. The festival has been organised by International Photo Media, and by its sister agency Images Live.</p>
